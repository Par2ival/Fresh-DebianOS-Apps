# Fresh-DebianOS-Apps
Quick script to install apps to a fresh DebianOS


## The Reason
Some might think im great at this and being helpfull to the comunity.... they would be wrong.
Im so bad at this I am often starting out fresh with a new OS :-)

## The Thing
A quick bash script that installs a list of apps from a text file.
This text file is full of common dependencies for the odd projects and toys im playing with.....it will be added to as time goes on I have no dought.

##Props
My mum....and maybe my Dad
